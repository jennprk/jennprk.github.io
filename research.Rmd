My primary research interest is in statistical genomics and genetics with DNAseq, bulk and single-cell RNAseq analysis. My recent research is in cancer genomics on breast cancer.

<br>

## 2020
+ A hierachical Bayesian model to test the difference in associations between risk factors and Mutational Signature

## 2019

+ PM2.5 effect on brain function based on mouse RNAseq 
    
    
<br>

+ Microbiome Project 2 - aVISTA + Cytoxan effect on breast cancer mice microbiome
    + Microbiome research based on mouse fecal samples DNA extraction and cutaneous humanbreast microbiome samples
    + Aim to determine the effects of aVISTA, Cyclophosphamide and Radiation Treatment effectson human and mice microbiome to understand the treatment effects on breast cancer.

<br>

## 2018 

+ Hypertension Research
    + Aim to determine the association of salt intake and hypertension, metabolic syndrome, andARB treatment effect from a 10K+ hypertension patients data attained from a K-MetS study
    
<br>

+ Myocardial Infarction(MI) - Stroke Research
    + Survival analysis to identify effect modification by demographics, stroke risk factors e.g. hypertension, diabetes, etc., and Charlson comorbidities
<br>

+ Microbiome Project 1 - Workflow development of microbiome data analysis
    + Develop a comprehensive workflow for microbiome data analysis based on our analysis
    + Analyze 16S rRNA gene sequence data from a study to understand the effect of fructose consumption on mouse gut microbiome
    
<br>

## 2017

+ Comparing clustering methods for single-cell RNA sequencing data
