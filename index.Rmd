I am starting my PhD in biostatistics at University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill in Fall 2019. I received a MS in biostatistics from Weill Cornell Medicine in 2018. Earlier I received a Bachelor in economics from Ewha Womans University in 2016.

My research interest is in genetics/genomics research based on RNAseq, scRNAseq, and microbiome.
