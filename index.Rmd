I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Biostatistics at University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill. I am currently working with Dr. [Michael Love](https://mikelove.github.io/) and Dr. [Di Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3NylkDkAAAAJ&hl=en) on developing statistical methods for analyzing genomics/genetics data. Before joining UNC, I finished my master's in Biostatistics and Data Science at Weill Cornell Medicine. At WCM, I worked with Dr. [Davide Risso](https://drisso.github.io/) on single-cell RNAseq research. Details can be found under [research](./research.html).
